## What's this?
Counter-Strike 2 SDK written in C++ to aid your development. This SDK has been written as simplified as possible and kept as close as possible to Source 2 code supporting both DirectX11 and Vulkan graphical APIs. I'll keep the project updated if I have time, project's features can be seen in the picture below. *Has been tested on **1.39.5.2**.*

## What's different from v1?
Now supports both Windows and Linux, main base logic has been refactored. I've gotten rid of the 'Inventory Changer' and skins altogether since I don't have the time to maintain them anymore, v1 can still be found [here.](https://github.com/bruhmoment21/cs2-sdk/tree/v1)

## Detection
*(This also applies for **v1**.)*

I'm guessing the base is **DETECTED** since the base uses generic approaches such as *trampoline hooking*. Hence the detection I recommend just seeing how stuff is done/works to try to implement it in your own project. Be creative!

## Building
